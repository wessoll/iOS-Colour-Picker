# iOS-Colour-Picker

About
=
When I was looking for a colour picker that could be used to change the colour of my WiFi bulbs, I found that almost all 
pickers out there still work very traditional. They operate on tiny squares that you have to select, or different sliders for the hue, saturation, and brightness.
None of them were making use of today's capabilites, like multi-touch. 

That's why I created this colour picker that you can operate on by 
using the already familiar gestures in iOS. It feels a lot more intuitive.

It uses two gradients to give a nice transition from one colour to the next. The average of the two gradients is used to determine the selected colour. 
This doesn't make it very accurate, but for me it was ok since the colour of the lightbulbs don't come that close. 

You can change the hue by panning up and down. Adjust the saturation by panning left and right. And adjust the brightness
by pinching in and out. 

Please enjoy!
